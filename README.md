## 📊 Dataset Overview

### Synthetic Data Generation

This project utilizes a sophisticated synthetic data generation approach to create realistic royalty transaction data that mirrors real-world conditions:

**Dataset Specifications:**
- **Volume**: 200,000 royalty transactions
- **Time Period**: 2-year analysis window (2022-2024)
- **Geographic Coverage**: 7 global regions
- **Licensing Channels**: 7 different revenue streams

### Data Schema

| Column | Description | Data Type | Business Logic |
|--------|-------------|-----------|----------------|
| `transaction_id` | Unique transaction identifier | String | Sequential format (TXN_XXXXXXXX) |
| `artist_id` | Artist identifier | String | Standardized format (Artist_XXXX) |
| `artist_name` | Artist display name | String | Realistic names using Faker library |
| `song_id` | Song catalog identifier | String | Unique song references (SONG_XXXXX) |
| `song_title` | Song title | String | Generated titles reflecting music industry patterns |
| `royalty_amount` | Payment amount in USD | Float | Exponential distribution with channel-specific multipliers |
| `distribution_date` | Payment distribution date | DateTime | Spread across analysis period with seasonal patterns |
| `payment_status` | Transaction processing status | String | 5 status types (Paid, Pending, Processing, Hold, Disputed) |
| `licensing_channel` | Revenue source | String | 7 channels with realistic industry distribution |
| `region` | Geographic market | String | Global coverage with weighted distribution |

### Intentional Data Quality Issues

To simulate real-world conditions, the following quality issues are systematically introduced:

**Missing Values (5% target rate):**
- Distributed across critical fields: artist_name, song_title, royalty_amount, payment_status, region
- Random distribution to simulate various data collection failures

**Duplicate Records (2% target rate):**
- Exact content duplicates with modified transaction IDs
- Tests deduplication logic and data integrity procedures

**Formatting Inconsistencies:**
- Case sensitivity issues in artist names (1,000 records)
- Whitespace irregularities in song titles (500 records)
- Validates text standardization processes

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process

### Comprehensive Data Standardization

The data cleaning process follows industry best practices for financial data processing:

#### 1. Duplicate Removal
- **Method**: Content-based deduplication excluding transaction IDs
- **Approach**: Preserve first occurrence to maintain data integrity
- **Validation**: Multi-step verification to ensure no false positives

#### 2. Missing Value Handling
- **Artist Names**: Intelligent imputation using artist_id mappings from valid records
- **Song Titles**: Systematic placeholder generation based on song_id patterns
- **Payment Status**: Default to most common status with business rule validation
- **Geographic Regions**: Default to 'Global' for missing regional data
- **Royalty Amounts**: Flag for manual review (critical financial data protection)

#### 3. Metadata Standardization
- **Text Normalization**: Title case formatting for artist names and song titles
- **Whitespace Management**: Trim leading/trailing spaces across all text fields
- **Data Type Optimization**: Convert categorical fields for memory efficiency
- **Date Standardization**: Ensure consistent datetime formatting

#### 4. Derived Field Creation
- **Temporal Analysis**: Extract year, month, quarter for trend analysis
- **Revenue Categorization**: Create royalty tiers (Micro, Small, Medium, Large, Premium)
- **Quality Flags**: Add review indicators for manual verification processes

## 🔍 Anomaly Detection

### Multi-Method Approach

The anomaly detection system employs three complementary methodologies to ensure comprehensive outlier identification:

#### 1. Z-Score Analysis (Statistical Method)
- **Threshold**: |z-score| > 3.0 standard deviations
- **Purpose**: Identify transactions that deviate significantly from normal distribution
- **Use Case**: Flag payments that are statistically unusual for general review

#### 2. Interquartile Range (IQR) Method
- **Formula**: Q1 - 1.5×IQR to Q3 + 1.5×IQR boundaries
- **Purpose**: Detect outliers based on quartile distributions
- **Use Case**: Identify payments outside typical industry ranges

#### 3. Isolation Forest (Machine Learning)
- **Algorithm**: Unsupervised machine learning approach
- **Features**: Royalty amount, temporal patterns, and derived metrics
- **Contamination Rate**: 5% expected outlier rate
- **Purpose**: Detect complex anomaly patterns not captured by statistical methods

### Composite Anomaly Scoring

- **Integration**: Combine results from all three methods
- **Confidence Levels**: Transactions detected by multiple methods receive higher priority
- **Business Rules**: Apply domain-specific logic for music industry context
- **Actionable Outputs**: Generate prioritized lists for manual review and investigation
